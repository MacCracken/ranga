# ranga — Claude Code Instructions

> **Core rule**: this file is **preferences, process, and procedures** —
> durable rules that change rarely. Volatile state (current version,
> module line counts, port progress, test counts, consumers) lives in
> [`docs/development/state.md`](docs/development/state.md).
> Do not inline state here.

## Project Identity

**ranga** — Cyrius port of a Rust project (13958 lines preserved at `rust-old/`).

- **Type**: Port (Rust → Cyrius)
- **License**: GPL-3.0-only
- **Language**: Cyrius (toolchain pinned in `cyrius.cyml [package].cyrius`)
- **Version**: `VERSION` at the project root is the source of truth — do not inline the number here
- **Standards**: [First-Party Standards](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/applications/first-party-standards.md) · [First-Party Documentation](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/applications/first-party-documentation.md)

## Goal

_TODO: one-or-two-sentence mission statement. What does ranga OWN in the stack? Durable — doesn't change per release._

## Current State

> Volatile state lives in [`docs/development/state.md`](docs/development/state.md) —
> port progress, surface parity, in-flight work. Refreshed every release.

This file (`CLAUDE.md`) is durable rules.

## Scaffolding

Project was scaffolded with `cyrius port`. Original Rust at `rust-old/` is the reference oracle — do not modify it; use it to find what is still missing and to catch porting mistakes.

## Quick Start

```sh
cyrius deps                              # resolve dependencies
cyrius build src/main.cyr build/ranga    # compile
cyrius test                              # run tests/*.tcyr
```

## Key Principles

- **Port direction is Rust → Cyrius** — Cyrius is the product; `rust-old/` is the code being retired. Use it to find what is still **missing** and to catch porting mistakes, never as the definition of correct. A Rust defect is fixed in Cyrius, not reproduced, and recorded in an ADR.
- **No silent divergence** — every difference from Rust is either a port mistake that gets fixed, or a deliberate improvement with an ADR
- Test after every change, not after the feature is "done"
- ONE change at a time — never bundle unrelated changes
- Build with `cyrius build`, not raw `cat file | cc5` — the manifest auto-resolves deps
- Source files only need project includes — stdlib auto-resolves from `cyrius.cyml`
- `var buf[N]` = N **bytes**, not N entries

## Rules (Hard Constraints)

- **Do not commit or push** — the user handles all git operations
- **Never use `gh` CLI** — use `curl` to the GitHub API if needed
- Do not modify `rust-old/` — it's the parity oracle
- Do not skip tests before claiming changes work
- Do not modify `lib/` files (vendored stdlib / dep symlinks)
- Do not hardcode toolchain versions in CI YAML — `cyrius = "X.Y.Z"` in `cyrius.cyml` is the source of truth
